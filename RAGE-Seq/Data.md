# Phenome-Genome Profiling of Single Bacterial Cell by Raman-activated Gravity-driven Encapsulation and Sequencing

## Abstract

The small size and low DNA amount of bacterial cells have hindered establishing
phenome-genome links in a precisely indexed, one-cell-per-reaction manner. Here we
present Raman-Activated Gravity-driven single-cell Encapsulation and Sequencing
(RAGE-Seq), where individual cells are phenotypically screened via single-cell Raman
spectra (SCRS) in an aquatic, vitality-preserving environment, then the cell with
targeted SCRS is precisely packaged in a picoliter microdroplet and readily exported in
a precisely indexed, “one-cell-one-tube” manner. Such integration of microdroplet
encapsulation to Raman-activated sorting ensures high-coverage one-cell genome
sequencing or cultivation that is directly linked to metabolic phenotype. For clinical
Escherichia coli isolates, genome assemblies derived from precisely one cell via
RAGE-Seq consistently reached >95% coverage. Moreover, directly from a urine
sample of urogenital tract infection, metabolic-activity-based antimicrobial susceptibility
phenotypes and genome sequence of 99.5% coverage were obtained simultaneously
from precisely one cell. This single-cell global mutation map corroborates resistance
phenotype and genotype, and unveils epidemiological features with high specificity and
sensitivity. The ability to profile and correlate bacterial metabolic phenome and highquality
genome sequences at one-cell resolution suggests broad application of RAGESeq.
